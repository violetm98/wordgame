## 1 Introduction

*This is a simple single player word game running on Android operating system*

## 2 Process Description
 ***
 
 - *Activity name: Create initial architecture design*
 - *Activity description: Go over each team member's UML class diagram and create initial architecture design*
 - *Entrance criteria: individual UML class diagram*
 - *Exit criteria: Initial low level architecture diagram signed off by all team members*
 
 ***

- *Activity name: Refine use case model*
- *Activity description: Define all use case scenarios. Create use case diagram to capture all critical use cases. Prioritize requirement based on use case model.*
- *Entrance criteria: Requirement specification and rough use case model*
- *Exit criteria: Output includes use case diagram , sequence diagram and detailed descriptions on each use case. Use case model
 and documentation needs to be reviewed and signed off by all team members. Above 90% use cases should be captured by the use case model*
 
 ***
 
 - *Activity name: Finalize architecture design*
 - *Activity description: high level design of system and sub system*
 - *Entrance criteria: Requirement specification, use case model and initial architecture diagram*
 - *Exit criteria: Output includes all relevant design diagrams including component, deployment, and class diagram which
 covers low-level design of all system components. System design should converge to a final stable version which can be agreed upon by all team members. All key use cases should be 
 addressed by the architecture design*
 
 ***
 
  - *Activity name: UI design*
  - *Activity description: Design system UI in the form of graphical mockups*
  - *Entrance criteria: Requirement specification and use case model and UI mockup tools*
  - *Exit criteria: UI prototype. UI mockup should be reviewed by all team members, positive feedback should be 
  integrated into the next iteration of the prototype.*
  
  ***
  
   - *Activity name: Create test plan*
   - *Activity description: Define test strategy and come up with concrete test cases without results*
   - *Entrance criteria: Requirement specification and use case model*
   - *Exit criteria: Test plan should be reviewed and signed off by all team members. test cases should attain above 90% use
   case coverage*
   
   ***
   - *Activity name: Define supplementary requirement*
   - *Activity description: Define all relevant non-functional requirement*
   - *Entrance criteria: Requirement specification and use case model*
   - *Exit criteria: Supplementary requirement should address non-functional requirement such as security, scalability, availability,
    maintainability,etc.*
    
   ***
   - *Activity name: Refine project plan*
   - *Activity description: Create project plan that defines activities perform in all phases*
   - *Entrance criteria: initial rough planning and risk assessment*
   - *Exit criteria: Refined plan of activities and estimates of resource*
   
   ***
   - *Activity name: Develop all product features*
   - *Activity description: All features developed and thoroughly tested. All use cases realized with traceability information. Product integrated to 
      Android mobile platform. Complete set of system test results. Finalize user manual*
   - *Entrance criteria: All artifacts generated from elaboration phase*
   - *Exit criteria: Stable version of beta release*
   
   ***
   - *Activity name: Refactoring, feature enhancement and bug fixes*
   - *Activity description: Code refactoring, implement feature enhancement and bug fixes. UAT can be performed by beta users. Current cycle retrospection*
   - *Entrance criteria: All artifacts generated from construction phase*
   - *Exit criteria: UAT testing performed, all test cases should pass*
